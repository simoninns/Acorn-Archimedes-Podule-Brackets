All brackets are in OpenSCAD format.  STL files for direct printing are included.

podule_join.scad - This is the piece required to join two half-width brackets. Dimensions are as per the Acorn mechanical drawings.  Screw holes are designed for M2.5 screws which will thead as they are screwed in.

podule_half_cover.scad - This is a half-width blanking plate.  Dimensions are as per the Acorn mechanical drawings.  If EMC protection is required simply use aluminium tape to cover both sides of the bracket.

mini-box-cd200_podule.scad - This is a bracket for the CF-200 CF card adaptor from mini-box.com.  The CF to IDE bracket fits directly on the bracket which can then be attached to the machine.  The bracket allows the CF card to be swapped without removing the cover from the computer.  Note that a compatible IDE podule (such as the IDEa) is required to connect the adaptor to the computer.
